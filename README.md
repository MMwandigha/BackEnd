This file sets up a basic Express.js application with routes for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting to-do items. It uses an in-memory database (todoItems) to store the to-do items.

Instructions:

1) First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2) Install Express.js and a middleware for parsing JSON data:
   npm install express body-parser
4) Start the server by running: node app.js
5) The RESTful API for the to-do list application should now run at 'http://localhost:3000'
